Prepare a salary report of the employees showing the details such as:
 EmpNo, Name, Basic Pay, DA, Gross Salary, PF, Net Salary, Annual Salary and Tax
 For this purpose, create a table named SALARIES having the following structure.

| Field Name  |         Type  |      Width  |
|  EmpNo      |   Character   |      10     |
|   Name      |     Character |         20  |
|  Basic      |   Numeric     |       6     |

Enter the records of at least 10 employees. Use the following information for 
calculating the details for the report:

DA is fixed as the 40% of the basic pay.
PF is fixed as 10% of the basic pay.
Gross Salary is (Basic Pay + DA).
Net Salary is (Gross Salary â€“ PF)
Annual Salary is (12 * Net Salary)

Tax is calculated using the following rules:

If annual salary is less than 100000, No Tax
If annual salary is greater than 100000 but less than or equal to 150000, then the tax is 10% of the excess over 100000.
If annual salary is greater than 150000 but less than or equal to 250000, then the tax is 20% of the excess over 150000.
If annual salary is greater than 250000, then the tax is 30% of the excess over 250000
