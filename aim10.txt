Question:
1. Create table exam_result(rollno, avg_score, Grade) insert 10 records. Assign

using the following condition.

avg_score between 90 and 100 - A
avg_score 75 -89 - B 
avg_score 60- 74 - C
avg_score 50 -59 - D
avg_score below 50 - E

Queries:
1. create table exam_result(rollno int primary key,avg_score int not null, grade char);
 
insert into exam_result values (1, 85, NULL), (2, 72, NULL), (3, 94, NULL), (4, 60, NULL), (5, 45, NULL),
(6, 88, NULL), (7, 78, NULL), (8, 99, NULL), (9, 63, NULL), (10, 53, NULL);
 
 select * from exam_result;
